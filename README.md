# Predict Heath Outcomes of Horses

This repository holds an attempt to train a model using machine learning that applies prediction outcome algorithms to determine whether a horse lived, died, or euthanized. Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e22/overview 

## Overview

The task, as defined by the Kaggle challenge is to use the given various medical indicators to predict the health outcomes of horses.The approach in this repository formulates the problem as a multi binary classification task, using different classification methods of machine learning like LGBMClassifier, Random Forest. The performance of each was compared between the different methods. The best model was able to predict the health outcome with a 67% accuracy.


### Data

* Data:
 * Train.csv consisted of 1235 rows and 29 columns.
 * Test.csv consisted of 824 rows and 28 columns.

    * Input: medical images (1000x1000 pixel jpegs), CSV file: image filename -> diagnosis
    * Input: CSV file of features, output: signal/background flag in 1st column.
  * Size: How much data?
  * Instances (Train, Test, Validation Split): how many data points? Ex: 1000 patients for training, 200 for testing, none for validation

#### Preprocessing / Clean up

* Describe any manipulations you performed to the data.

#### Data Visualization

Show a few visualization of the data and say a few words about what you see.

### Problem Formulation

* Define:
  * Input / Output
  * Models
    * Describe the different models you tried and why.
  * Loss, Optimizer, other Hyperparameters.

### Training

* Describe the training:
  * How you trained: software and hardware.
  * How did training take.
  * Training curves (loss vs epoch for test/train).
  * How did you decide to stop training.
  * Any difficulties? How did you resolve them?

### Performance Comparison

* Clearly define the key performance metric(s).
* Show/compare results in one table.
* Show one (or few) visualization(s) of results, for example ROC curves.

### Conclusions

* State any conclusions you can infer from your work. Example: LSTM work better than GRU.

### Future Work

* What would be the next thing that you would try.
* What are some other studies that can be done starting from here.

## How to reproduce results

* In this section, provide instructions at least one of the following:
   * Reproduce your results fully, including training.
   * Apply this package to other data. For example, how to use the model you trained.
   * Use this package to perform their own study.
* Also describe what resources to use for this package, if appropirate. For example, point them to Collab and TPUs.

### Overview of files in repository

* Describe the directory structure, if any.
* List all relavent files and describe their role in the package.
* An example:
  * utils.py: various functions that are used in cleaning and visualizing data.
  * preprocess.ipynb: Takes input data in CSV and writes out data frame after cleanup.
  * visualization.ipynb: Creates various visualizations of the data.
  * models.py: Contains functions that build the various models.
  * training-model-1.ipynb: Trains the first model and saves model during training.
  * training-model-2.ipynb: Trains the second model and saves model during training.
  * training-model-3.ipynb: Trains the third model and saves model during training.
  * performance.ipynb: loads multiple trained models and compares results.
  * inference.ipynb: loads a trained model and applies it to test data to create kaggle submission.

* Note that all of these notebooks should contain enough text for someone to understand what is happening.

### Software Setup
* List all of the required packages.
* If not standard, provide or point to instruction for installing the packages.
* Describe how to install your package.
